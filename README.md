A (very) simple UI program to control the Sony-WF1000XM5 earbuds on Linux. Only a subset of the features are implemented. To use it, download the binaries for your platform from the [release page](https://github.com/usering-around/sony-wf1000xm5-controller/releases/tag/v0.1.0) or you can build and run locally via  `cargo run --release` or `cargo run --profile superopt` for extra optimizations.
